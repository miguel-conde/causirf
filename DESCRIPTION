Title: Hen-or-Egg Causality Analysis
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Miguel Conde
Maintainer: Miguel Conde <miguelco2000@gmail.com>
Description: Based upon the existence of an impulse response function (IRF) connecting two stochastic processes, the utils in this package allow to identify  necessary conditions for the existence of a (linear) causal link either from x to y or y to x, or of a hen-or-egg (HOE) situation in which causal influences  appear to go in both directions.
